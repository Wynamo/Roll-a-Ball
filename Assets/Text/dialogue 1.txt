Hellllooo there, young Orb!
How do you do on this fine day?
...
Not much of a talker are you?
...
Well uh, anyway I was wondering if you could help me out of a pickle I've found myself in.
I seemed to have missplaced my magic bubbles...
Yes I have magic bubbles, what of it?
How do you think I keep my youthful glow?
Anyway I was hoping you could assist me in retrieving them. I would go myself, but my uh legs(?), aren't too good for it anymore.
I'd be forever greatful!
Here you can even have one of my "Orbs of healy-ness".
Yes I know that name isn't great, I just came up with it now.
Regardless, they can restore your energy. Maybe even save your life. You might have need of them soon.
Anyway I won't keep you any longer. Good luck out there kiddo!
