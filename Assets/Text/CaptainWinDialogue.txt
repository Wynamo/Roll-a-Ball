Arrr! You actually managed to find them all? 
Surely you jest.
Well sink me! I'm impressed boy-o!
Those bilge-sucking creatures didn't give ye much trouble, did they?
...
Good to hear, lad. Though I doubt that's the last we'll see of those scallywags...
I saw a bunch of those bilge rats taking a bunch of me brothers bubbles down the old well.
That place ran dry years ago. But me thinks they may have made it their home.
Now I'm a man of the seas, I'm no stranger to taking refuge in foreign lands.
But I think those lily livered, scum suckers be up to no good.
I don't know what they want with me brother's bubbles, but I can't stand by and let 'em have their way.
...
Oh no! I won't be going lad.
I uh-be fighting off scurvy at the moment...
But I can lend ye some advice for what comes next.
The old well I spoke of be southeast of me brother's shack.
It'll lead ya to wear those booty-snatchin water breathers be headed.
There could be tons down there so watch yerself, lad.
One wrong step and ye could be sinking into the briney deep.
I'll be rootin for ye, best of luck, spherical swashbucker!
