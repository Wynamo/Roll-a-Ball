Ah well that wasn't very long at all!
You managed to find all of the bubbles?
...
Yeah I guess that's a stupid question.
I appreciate the help, kiddo...Unfortunately I've got some news.
I...Actually had a lot more bubbles than that.
...
Yeah I probably should've told you that earlier, huh?
...
Look when ya get to my age you start slipping, mentally AND literally.
... I told that darn kid he should be putting up wet floor signs but NnOoOoO!
I swear kids these days, so lazy...
Bah-ANYWAY!
I was hoping you could maybe go get the rest of them..?
...
Great! I knew you'd say yes!
...
I don't exactly know where they are, but there's someone who might be able to help.
My brother lives on this island, a ways up the road to the north.
He knows this place better than anyone, maybe he's seen some of my bubbles floating around.
Though I must warn you, if you think I'M crazy, you haven't seen anything yet.
...
Yes well I'm sure you're a very busy sphere, so I'll let you get going.
Good luck, young orb.
