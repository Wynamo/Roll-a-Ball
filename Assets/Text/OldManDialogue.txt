Hellllooo there, young Orb!
How do you do on this fine day?
...
Not much of a talker are you?
...
Well uh, anyway I was wondering if you could help me out of a pickle I've found myself in.
I seemed to have missplaced my magic bubbles...
Yes I have magic bubbles, what of it?
How do you think I keep my youthful glow?
Anyway I was hoping you could assist me in retrieving them. I would go myself, but my uh legs(?), aren't too good for it anymore.
I like to explore the paths around this little meadow, I must have missplaced them on my walk today.
..?
Yes I take my magic bubbles on walks, so what?
Whatever, look I'll give you one of my "Orbs of healy-ness" for your troubles.
Yes I know that name isn't great, I just came up with it now.
Regardless, they can restore your energy. Maybe even save your life. You might have need of them soon.
Once you find all my magic bubbles, let me know.
A good place to start would be the garden right at my house here.
Anyways, good luck out there, Kiddo!
